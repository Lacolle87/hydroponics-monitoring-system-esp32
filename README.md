# hydroponics-monitoring-system-esp32
 This repository contains the code for a hydroponics monitoring system based on ESP32 microcontroller, which is used to measure and monitor the pH and TDS levels of the hydroponic solution, temperature and humidity of air and solution. The data is then transmitted over WiFi using MQTT protocol to a designated server, where it can be analyzed and visualized.
